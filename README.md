# Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn

This repository contains my personal implementations and notes as I work through the book:

> *Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn*  
> by Sebastian Raschka, Yuxi Liu, and Vahid Mirjalili

The goal is to deepen my understanding of machine learning by implementing the code examples, making small modifications, and experimenting.
